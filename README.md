# Color-Switcher-Project

A simple JavaScript project to dynamically change the background color of the webpage by clicking on color button.

## 🚀 Features

- Change background color using buttons.
- Uses `id` of the button to apply corresponding color.
- Lightweight and beginner-friendly DOM project.


## 🧠 How it Works

- Multiple buttons are assigned different `id`s (like `blue`, `grey`, `yellow`, etc.)
- When a button is clicked, an event listener triggers and reads the `id`.
- That `id` is used as the background color value for the `<body>` element.

## 💻 Tech Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (DOM Manipulation)
